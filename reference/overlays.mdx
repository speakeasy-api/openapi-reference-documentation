# Overlays

Overlays allow us to modify an existing OpenAPI document without directly editing the original document. An overlay is a separate document that contains instructions for updating the original OpenAPI document.

<Callout title="Active Development" variant="warning">
The [OpenAPI Overlay Specification](https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification) is still under active development, and is therefore not considered stable. However, it is supported by Speakeasy and many other tools in the OpenAPI ecosystem.
</Callout>

Overlays are useful for:

- Separating concerns between the original API definition and modifications required by different consumers or use cases.
- Avoiding direct modification of the original OpenAPI document, which may be managed by a separate team or process.
- Applying a set of common modifications to multiple OpenAPI documents.

## Overlay Document Structure

An Overlay document is a separate document from the OpenAPI document it modifies. It contains an ordered list of [Action Objects](#action-object) that describe the modifications to be made to the original OpenAPI document.

The `extends` field is optional. If not provided, it is the responsibility of tooling to determine which OpenAPI documents the overlay should be applied to.

## Overlay Specification Versions

The `overlay` field contains the version number of the Overlay Specification that the document conforms to. Tooling should use this value to interpret the document correctly.

The current version of the Overlay Specification is `1.0.0`, but keep in mind that the specification is still under development.

## Overlay Info Object

| Field Name    | Type    | Required           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target`      | String  | ✅ | A [JSONPath](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jsonpath/documents/) expression that specifies the location in the original OpenAPI document where the change should be made. See [Action Targets](#action-targets). |

| `x-*`         | Any     |  | Any number of extension fields can be added to the Action Object that can be used by tooling and vendors.                                                                                                         |

## Action Targets

The `target` field of an [Action Object](#action-object) is a [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expression that specifies the locations in the original OpenAPI document where the change should be made.

JSONPath expressions allow you to select and manipulate specific parts of a JSON or YAML document using an intuitive syntax. The expressions are similar to XPath for XML, allowing you to traverse the document tree and select elements based on various criteria.

JSONPath is [implemented differently](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/) across tooling languages and among individual tools. Speakeasy uses [VMware Labs YAML JSONPath](https://github.com/vmware-labs/yaml-jsonpath) to parse JSONPath.

Here are some examples of JSONPath expressions relevant to OpenAPI documents:

| JSONPath Expression                                                                        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$.info.title`                                                                             | Selects the `title` field of the `info` object.                             |
| `$.servers[0].url`                                                                         | Selects the `url` field of the first server in the `servers` array.         |
| `$.paths['/drinks'].get.parameters`                                                        | Selects the `parameters` of the `get` operation on the `/drinks` path.      |
| `$.paths..parameters[?(@.in=='query')]`                                                    | Selects all query parameters across all paths.                              |
| `$.paths.*[?(@..parameters.*[?(@.in=='query')])]`                                          | Selects all operations that have one or more query parameters.              |
| `$.paths.*[?(@..parameters.*[?(@.in=='query')])]['post','get','put','path','delete'].tags` | Selects tags of specific operations that have one or more query parameters. |
| `$.components.schemas.Drink`                                                               | Selects the `Drink` schema from the `components.schemas` object.            |

When selecting the object to target for different types of updates, consider the following:

| Type of Update                                       | Target Object          |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Updating a primitive value (string, number, boolean) | The containing object |
| Updating an object                                   | The object itself    |
| Updating an array                                    | The array itself      |
| Adding a new property to an object                   | The object itself     |
| Adding a new item to an array                        | The array itself      |
| Removing a property from an object                   | The object itself     |
| Removing an item from an array                       | The array itself      |

For example, to update the `description` field of the `info` object, you would target the `info` object itself:

```yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Update Speakeasy API description
  version: 1.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.info
    update:
      description: The Speakeasy Bar API is a secret underground bar that serves drinks to those in the know.
```

To remove a specific path, such as `/oldDrinks`, from the `paths` object, you would target that path directly:

```yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Remove deprecated drinks path
  version: 1.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths['/oldDrinks']
    remove: true
```

## Applying an Overlay

When an overlay is applied, the `update` object is merged with the targeted objects. Any properties present in both the `update` object and the targeted objects will be replaced with the values from the `update` object. New properties from the `update` object will be added to the targeted objects.

The Overlay document is processed in the following order:

1. Tooling locates the original OpenAPI document to modify. This is based on the `extends` field if provided, otherwise determined by the tooling.

2. Each [Action Object](#action-object) is applied to the OpenAPI documents in the order they appear in the `actions` array.

   For each action:

   1. The `target` JSONPath expression is evaluated against the OpenAPI document to locate the objects to modify.

   2. If the `remove` field is `true`, the targeted objects are removed from the OpenAPI document.

   3. If the `remove` field is `false` or not provided and an `update` object is specified, the `update` object is merged with each of the targeted objects.

## Overlay Examples

Here are some examples of overlays that could be applied to the Speakeasy Bar OpenAPI document:

## Updating Info and Servers

This example demonstrates updating the `info` and `servers` objects in the original OpenAPI document.

```yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Update Speakeasy Bar Info and Servers 
  version: 1.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.info
    update:
      description: The Speakeasy Bar API is a secret underground bar that serves drinks to those in the know.
      contact:
        name: Speakeasy Bar Support
        email: support@speakeasy.bar
  - target: $.servers
    update:  
      - url: https://staging.speakeasy.bar/v1
        description: Staging server
      - url: https://api.speakeasy.bar/v1  
        description: Production server
```

## Adding Tags and Updating Drink Responses

This example demonstrates adding tags to the OpenAPI document and updating response objects for operations related to drinks.

```yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Add Tags and Update Drink Responses
  version: 1.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.tags
    update:
      - name: Drinks
        description: Operations related to managing drinks
      - name: Orders  
        description: Operations related to order processing
  - target: $.paths['/drinks'].get.responses[200].content['application/json'].schema
    update:
      $ref: "#/components/schemas/DrinkList"
  - target: $.paths['/drinks/{drinkId}'].get.responses[200].content['application/json'].schema 
    update:
      $ref: "#/components/schemas/Drink"
```

## Adding Query Parameter Tags

This example demonstrates adding a tag to all operations that have query parameters.

```yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Add Query Parameter Tags
  version: 1.0.0
actions:
  - target: $.paths.*[?(@..parameters.*[?(@.in=='query')])]['post','get','put','path','delete'].tags
    update:
      - hasQueryParameters
```

## Removing Deprecated Drink Operations

This example demonstrates removing operations related to drinks that have been marked as deprecated.

```yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Remove Deprecated Drink Operations
  version: 1.0.0
actions:  
  - target: $.paths['/drinks'].*.deprecated
    remove: true
  - target: $.paths['/drinks/{drinkId}'].*.deprecated  
    remove: true
```
